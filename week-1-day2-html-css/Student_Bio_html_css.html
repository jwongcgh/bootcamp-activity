    <p>There is a possibility that this little fellow speaks more languages than I do. Whether it is true or not, I am sure what he/she has to say is delightful and more engaging than any subject I choose to talk about.</p>
    <p>He/she is a Sun Conure parrot. Though they are considered to be not very good talkers, the can imitate sounds and perform tricks.</p>
    <p>Could it be that they don't talk much because they find our daily dialogues meaningless?</p>  
    <p>Perhaps, starting a regular conversation with us is opening a Pandora box that cannot be closed back. Thus they might be quite smart at limiting the line of communication between them and us to only when they are ready to put up with us.</p>
